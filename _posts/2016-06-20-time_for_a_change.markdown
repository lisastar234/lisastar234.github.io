Begin at the beginning.....

Five years ago, a day before Father's day, my husband and I adopted our son. I had left a job for various reasons a few months prior knowing that we would be concentrating on the adoption process (an arduous and emotional undertaking with an unknown potential waiting period that could be two days or two years--there is no way to know). I was thinking about work---how long should I wait to look for another job during this time of stasis? I had just completed a graduate degree in public policy the year before and wasn't really ready to stop working but I also hoped (overly-optimistically) that our wait time to begin our family would be short. And then a month later it happened. There was our son. We had a week to prepare and then were launched into being parents. Paid work became the furthest thing from my mind. 

Time lapse...three years...go back to work? I was enjoying being home too much. I had one chance to be a mom to a small child and I was lucky enough to be able to (sort of) afford it financially (although taking a potentially much greater hit professionally). However, I knew from working at a think tank that studied women and work, work/life balance and stay at home moms onboarding back to work that once I did make the decision to go back to work it would be a potential challenge to find a job and also find some semblance of balance. 

One of my previous professional incarnations was that of rare book librarian and archivist. Was this something I was still interested in? I took some online xml courses, some metadata courses, some MOOG courses and strangely of all-- an anachronistic book indexing course. People still index books believe it or not. It's been twelve years since I've worked in a library and I wasn't super excited to try to get back into that world. Put a line through that route as a potential professional path.

How could I combine my experience as a librarian and all that knowledge (and my love of cataloging and organizing data) with my graduate degree in public policy which I only dabbled in really? How could I keep my mind nimble, do something for myself by learning something new and potentially learn something that would 1). provide a potential salary 2). help develop a professional path and 3). be exciting and fulfilling enough to make me want to be there instead of being home full-time?

I started with revisiting HTML (which I knew from being a "webmaster"--these existed in the 1990s at the library I worked at). I took some online courses and then learned CSS (my webmaster days preceded the existence of CSS). This past fall I attended a twelve week course through the New York Public Library that taught HTML and CSS. I had also taken many free and nominal fee online courses in HTML, CSS and JS. But I wasn't sure I wanted to just do front-end stuff. The field seems saturated and I'm not really so design-y. I signed up for a fee-based three month online course in Ruby. Not too much depth and certainly not enough knowledge to get a job but enough to peek my interest. 

The next step...I signed up for Learn. I couldn't commit to an in person bootcamp. I didn't want to be away from my son for that many hours even if it was a limited timeframe and I couldn't afford a babysitter without a job. This was the best option for me. It's been hard. I've not been able to dedicate as much time as I like and I struggle with keeping on track. Learning Ruby is like learning Finnish for me, but it's time for me to try to get back into the world of the working. My son starts kindergarten next year and will need me a bit less during the day. It's time to do something for myself again and hopefully in the long run for him. 

Learning a new skill right now is also coming at a great time as my son is learning so many new skills. He is acquiring so much knowledge every day that it is humbling to be an adult also learning new things. As he learns to read and write new words and is better understanding more sophisticated math concepts and just how to negotiate the world in general, learning something difficult myself has given me a lot of empathy for him. I get it. It's hard and there is so much to learn. This has also been a lesson for him-- to see his mom pushing through something that is challenging and not giving up. It's a lesson that is so important for both of us. Persistance and wanting to get it right. This experience has also been a lesson in realizing that we really all do learn differently. Sometimes knowledge comes quickly and clicks, sometimes it is very slow but has amazing payoff when we get to the answer. I hope to make my son proud--as he makes me proud--and that he remembers back to the days when his mom was glued to a keyboard learning something new and difficult that turned out to be worth the challenge.

I hope this course will give me the skills to re-enter the workforce and the opportunity to do something that combines all my working knowledge and experience to work on projects that have social value and impact. I have played, looked at and deleted many educational kids programs over the years--I would love the chance to work on something better to help kids of all ages learn. And if not educational programming than perhaps something in government or a non-profit? I not only want to have my son seeing me do work that I love but that makes a difference for him and his world. Cliche perhaps, but true.
